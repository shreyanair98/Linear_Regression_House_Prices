Building a linear regression model in Python using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Sci-kit learn, MatplotLib to predict housing prices.

The housing price dataset was found from Kaggle and then split into a training and testing dataset, with SalePrice as the target variable.

After the model was built, it was evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared values, as well as plotted to visualize expected vs predicted values.
